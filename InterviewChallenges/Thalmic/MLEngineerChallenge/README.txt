IMPORTANT: You will need to modify the file names in the Python programs to match those you add to the TestData folder
	

5 items are contained within this zip file:


TestData Directory: In this directory remove current Gesture{}Test.txt files and place new test data examples

modelparameters Directory: In this directory are the parameters referenced by the models

PredictGesture.py: This program provides the optimal classification accuracy. It will use TensorFlow and the trained Deep Neural Network to predict classification results

PredictGestureNoTF.py: If you do not have TensorFlow installed, PredictGestureNoTF.py will predict classication results using the trained Logistic Regression model (the best model not using TensorFlow)

SchneiderThalmicMLChallengeReport.pdf: Report of the process taken to produce the PredictGesture programs.
