#Question: Imagine looking at Polish carsâ€™ licence plates and trying to find a word from
# the dictionary that includes all the letters from the licence plate. The shorter the word,
# the better. The licence plates start with two or three letters, then they are followed by
# 5 characters, from which at most 2 are letters, the rest are digits.

#Your goal is to write code that will find the shortest words for 1xdif-100 licence plates. You
# are given a dictionary.

#e.g. for the licence plate "RT 123SO" the shortest word would be "SORT", for "RC 10014":
# "CAR".
